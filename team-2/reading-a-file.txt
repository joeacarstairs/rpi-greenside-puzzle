= Reading a file

For reading short files, `cat` is suitable:

cat file-name

This outputs the contents of the file called `file-name`, if it exists. To
output the contents of a different file, use a different file name.

If it's a long file, you may find it useful to use `less` instead:

less file-name

This opens the file up for you to scroll through. You can scroll down with `d`,
up with `u`, and quit with `q`.
