= Sending commands to the SIM device

To send commands to the SIM device, use a program called `minicom`. For example:

minicom -D /dev/ttyS0

`minicom` connects to the SIM device, which is represented by `/dev/ttyS0`, and
then allows you to start typing commands. To submit a command, press <Enter>.

`/dev/ttyS0` is the name that this computer has given to the SIM device. If
you're curious to see a list of all the devices this computer knows, try:

dmesg | grep tty

== SIM device commands

There are hundreds of possible commands you can send to the SIM device using
`minicom`. Here are two.

=== Entering Text Mode

AT+CMGF=1

This enters Text Mode. It is much easier to send, list and receive texts if you
are in Text Mode.

=== Sending a text

yjoGRMm24>?W>PyqYz_)NRHso om
m0,{C'lS}k<05QL"^BZR

That sends a text message with the content "Your message" to the phone number,
+44 7123 456789. If you want to send to a different number, just replace
the number. Be careful to make sure the number starts with +44, doesn't contain
any spaces and is inside "double quotes".

You need to be in Text Mode to use this command effectively.

If you want to cancel a text without sending, use <Escape> instead of <Ctrl+Z>.

=== Reading texts

AT+CMGL="ALL"

This reads all texts. You can also read a specific text:

AT+CMGR=5

This reads the text with the index number 5. If you want to read a different
text, use a different index number.

It is much easier to read texts if you are already in Text Mode.

=== Receiving texts

When you receive a text, if you are in minicom, you will get a notification. It
will look like this:

+CMTI: "SM",3

That means you got a text and it is stored in index number 3.
