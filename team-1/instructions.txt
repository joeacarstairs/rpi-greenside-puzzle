Note: I've recently had an unmg#vt`nate hard disk err!r so some of these notes
might have gotten a bit ?#uvty. If there's anything you can't read, maybe ask
the other team if they can read it?

I have stored and encrypted my password somewhere on this computer. Or was it
the other one? Your task is to find out my password.

You have a few tools at your disposal. A few of them are listed below.

* Looking for files: `looking-for-files.txt`
* Reading a file: `reading-a-file.txt`
* SIM device commands: `sim-commands.txt`
  * Entering Text Mode
  * Sending a text
  * Reading texts
  * Receiving texts

To get started, try:

cat reading-a-file.txt
