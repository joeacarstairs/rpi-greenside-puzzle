= Cipher example

Write out the 'from' cipher on top of the 'to' cipher. For example:

zed bcu pqa rts wlx ymo nfj hvg ki
lws tra qpu cbd ezi kgv hjf nom yx

Then you encrypt your message by turning every letter in the top row into the
letter directly beneath it in the bottom row. So 'z' becomes 'l', 'e' becomes
'w', and so on.

For example:

hello world
nwzzv evczs

To decrypt it, of course, you have to go the opposite way.
