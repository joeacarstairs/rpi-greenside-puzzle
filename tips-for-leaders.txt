= Tips for leaders

Print this off and have it available during the activity.

== Before starting

- Get the equipment ready:
  - Deconstructible mobile phone (optional)
  - Paper and pencils
  - 2 Raspberry Pi computers
  - 2 Raspberry Pi power supplies
  - 2 monitors with HDMI cables and power supplies
  - 2 keyboards
  - 2 GSM-GPRS HATs
  - 2 pre-paid SIM cards
  - Cheat sheet for leaders
- Do a full setup for both computers and check everything is working. Send and
  receive a text both ways.
- Delete all texts off both SIMs:
  - `AT+CMGL="ALL"` to list all texts
  - `AT+CMGD=<index>` to delete each text
  - `AT+CMGL="ALL"` to double-check they're all gone
- Deconstruct everything you want to get the Scouts to set it up themselves
- The equipment should be split into separate rooms for each team, near
  an adequate power supply
- Brief other leaders

== Introducing the Scouts

- Ideally: deconstruct a mobile phone
- Show them a computer, let them pass it around and have a closer look
- Get volunteers to construct a setup (without GSM-GPRS at first)
- Demonstrate some basic commands
- Get them to add the GSM-GPRS HAT with the SIM card
- Split into 2 teams
- Write `cat instructions.txt` on 2 separate pieces of paper and give one to
  each team
- Distribute adequate paper and pencils to both teams
- Send each team to their equipment

== Facilitating

- Make sure pencil and paper is available
- Encourage the Scouts to take *careful* notes of everything they learn
- There will be considerable idle time. Be prepared to make good use of it:
  - Get them to think through their thought process
  - Prompt them towards what the next step in the puzzle is going to be
  - If they have phones, get them to text themselves and send a reply
  - If you're keen, feel free to have open discussions about computing:
    - How do they interact with or depend upon computers? Where can they see
      computers in their lives? Where might computers be at work in their lives
      that they can't see?
    - Have a look at the computer. Where is the processor? Where is the
      storage?
    - Consider how the technology we're using now is inside all of their
      phones. It's just that the tricky bits are being done automatically by
      computer programs. Consider how writing computer programs can make work
      easier and open new possibilities.
  - Maybe have a mini-game in your back pocket as a last resort

== Troubleshooting and FYIs

- If you type `cat` without a filename, you'll get stuck. Quit `cat` with Ctrl+C
- If minicom won't send messages to the SIM device, or it returns errors
  unexpectedly, you may need to adjust the physical contacts for the SIM card.
  All three contacts must be engaged.
- If AT commands are behaving strangely, consider if the Scouts have remembered
  to enter Text Mode with `AT+CMGF=1`. They should have made a note of this!
- As far as I can tell, you can't read sent texts using the commands described
- In minicom, arrow keys do not work well. Backspace should work fine, though
