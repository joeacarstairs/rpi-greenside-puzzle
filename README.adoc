= Raspberry Pi SMS puzzle for 154th Greenside Scouts

To solve this puzzle, you need two Raspberry Pis, each plugged into a GSM/GPRS
HAT. Clone this repository onto both Raspberry Pis, but on one machine, delete
everything except the `team-1` folder, and on the other, delete everything
except the `team-2` folder. Navigate into those respective folders, and you're
ready to go.
